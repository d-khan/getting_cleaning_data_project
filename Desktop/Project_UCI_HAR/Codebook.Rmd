##Codebook - Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones Data Set

**Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones Data Set is taken from the following publication:**

Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012

* Total number of variables: 68
* Total number of observations: 180
* Missing values: None
* XYZ: Triaxial signals (3-axial signals in the X, Y, and Z directions)


**Steps taken to clean data set**

*There are 13 objects used from step 1-12. Objects are shown below in boldface and italics.*

1. Download dataset, check data set for missing values, type of data, dimensions (# of variables and observations).
2. Load test and train dataset in ***test*** and ***train*** objects respectively.
3. Load feature, extract column names and save in ***feature*** object.
4. Load test and train activity in ***test_activity*** and ***train_activity*** objects respectively and replace activity ID by activity name.
5. Load test subject and train subject in ***subject_test*** and ***subject_train*** respectively.
6. Column bind ***subject_test***,***test_activity*** and ***test*** datasets to get test dataset. The test dataset has 2947 observations and 563 variables.
7. Column bind ***subject_train***,***train_activity*** and ***train*** datasets to get train dataset. The train dataset has 7352 observations and 563 variables.
8. Row bind ***train*** and ***test*** datasets to get ***train_test*** dataset. The dataset has 10299 observations and 563 variables.
9. Column names which includes mean() and std() are extracted along with subject and activity and saved in ***train_test_extract*** object. The variables in extracted dataset has gone down to 68 variables.
10. Change column names in ***train_test_extract***. Following are the replacements done:
    * mean() to mean
    * std() to std
    * BodyBody to Body
    * -- to _
11. Using 'dcast', taking Subject & Activity and calculate mean on each variable and save dataset into ***tidy_dataset***. The ***tidy_dataset*** has 180 observations and 68 variables. There are 30 subjects x 6 activity which reflects correct total number of observations.
12. Write ***tidy_dataset*** into 'tidy_dataset.txt' file.
